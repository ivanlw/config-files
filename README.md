**tube-vim** is a integrated shell-based development environment that you can easily set up by **running a single command**:

```
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolinwei/tube-vim/master/install.sh)
```

It includes best practical Vim setting with a bunch of must-have plugins managed by modern [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), together with decent color schemes [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) ([gruvbox-terminal](https://github.com/flipxfx/gruvbox-terminal) | [gruvbox-generalized](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-generalized)). The used plugins will be listed and explained below.

Different from other integrated Vim configuration, **tube-vim** also uses Z shell (zsh)'s wrapper **oh-my-zsh** ([Github](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) | [Official size](http://ohmyz.sh/)) as the replacement of system default bash shell. Due to its full compatibility with bash, you can switch to zsh easily without any learning curse while you can also enjoy a lot new benefits listed [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki).

## Installation

### For OS X
1. (Optional) Strongly recommend to install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) ([direct link](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2_v2_0.zip)) as Terminal replacement since this repo includes color scheme spesifically for it, and you can enjoy more features not only [here](https://iterm2.com/features.html)

2. Run the following command to install the environment automatically
     ```
     bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolinwei/tube-vim/master/install.sh)
     ```

3. Change the color scheme for Terminal or iTerm2 depends on which one you're using
    + For Terminal
    
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolinwei/tube-vim/master/preview/terminal.png" alt="terminal preference" width="400" />
    + For iTerm2
    
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolinwei/tube-vim/master/preview/iterm2.png" alt="terminal preference" width="500" />

4. We provide a `.screenrc` configuration file that helps you to better use `screen` command, it will be placed during the installation

### For *nix

Ôºç If you're using *nix, we value you as an experienced user, and due to so many variation of *nix distribution, it's nearly impossible to provide a single installation script to cover all the cases. We ask you to have some prerequisites before running the setup script

1. Have [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) installed in your system. It is normally included in system's package and used by [neocopmlete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) for auto comletion. Type the following command to check installation:
    
     ```
     lua -v
     ```
     
     If you can't see any version information printed out, you may, for example, install Lua on a Ubuntu box using the following command 
     
     ```
     sudo apt-get install lua5.2
     ```
2. Have your `git`, `wget` and other compilation tools installed. In a typical Ubuntu machine, you can normally install them using

     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade
     sudo apt-get install wget git
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```
     
3. Have Vim 7.4 with lua support. To verify this, you can type `echo has("lua")` inside Vim then check whether the output is `1`, or you can type `vim --version` to see if `+lua` is among the list. A suggested way of installation is to compile from source code in the following way

     ```
     wget ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.4.tar.bz2
     tar jxf vim-7.4.tar.bz2
     cd vim74/
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ \
                 --with-features=huge \
                 --enable-multibyte \
                 --enable-rubyinterp \
                 --enable-pythoninterp \
                 --with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib/python2.7/config \
                 --enable-perlinterp \
                 --enable-luainterp \
                 --enable-gui=gtk2 --enable-cscope --prefix=/usr
     make && sudo make install
     ```
     
     If you encounter issues during installation, try to refer to [this](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) in YouCompleteMe's Github wiki.
       
4. Then boom! You can just use the similar command to start the installation
 
     ```
     bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolinwei/tube-vim/master/install-linux.sh)
     ```

## Major features and key mappings

####>>> Color Schemes <<<
We prepared color schemes **[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)** ([gruvbox-terminal](https://github.com/flipxfx/gruvbox-terminal) | [gruvbox-generalized](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-generalized)), which is all fantastic and eye-protective for you.

####>>> Vundle <<<
**tube-vim** is using **[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)** as the plugin management tool, it allows you to keep track of and configure your plugins right inside `.vimrc` file, so that you can download all the plugins in one command if you change your development environment, of course you can also update, clean them conveniently.

**Commands**
- Enter Vim and then run `:PluginInstall` to install plugins defined in your `.vimrc`
- Run `vim +PluginInstall +qall` from shell for installation too
- Run `:PluginList` from within Vim or `vim +PluginList` to show the installed plugin(s), move your cursor to certain plugin, press D (Shift+d) to delete that plugin

####>>> vim-airline <<<
**[vim-airline](https://github.com/tolinwei/vim-airline)** is a super pretty lean & mean status/tabline that's light as air, which is regarded as the replacement of deprecated [vim-powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline). It is integrated with plugins like [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) and [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar). We tweaked a little bit of the theme we're using and make it more clear when switching between NORMAL mode and INSERT mode.

####>>> NERDTree <<<
**[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)** is a file explorer taht allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files or directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree in which you can manipulate with the keyboard or mouse (GUI vims like [macvim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim)).

**Shortcuts**

- `<Control>+n` - Toggle NERDTree
- `<Control>+w` then `w` - Switch between panes of Vim
- `<Control>+w` then `<left>` - Switch to the left pane of Vim
- `<Control>+w` then `<right>` - Switch to the right pane of Vim

when your cursor is in NERDTree's pane
- `o` or `<Enter>` - Open that file or expend that directory the cursor points to
- `R` (`<Shift>+r`) - Refresh the tree, useful if files change outside of Vim
- `U` (`<Shift>+u`) - Show upper level directory

For more shortcuts, please refer to a external [NERDTree Guide](http://usevim.com/2012/07/18/nerdtree/)

####>>> Indent Guides <<<
**[vim-indent-guides](https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides)** is a plugin for visually displaying indent levels in Vim. Plus, you can fold your function or logic trunk (like `if` or `else` statements), by the deepest level of indent guides.

**Shortcuts**

- `z then a` - Fold or un-fold the code trunk, by the deepest level of indent guide

####>>> Tagbar <<<
**[Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar)** is a Vim plugin as class outline viewer, which provides a easy way to browse the tags (variable names, function/method names and etc.) of current file and get a overview of its structure). It does this by creating a sidebar (on the right side by default) the displays the ctags-generated tags of current file, ordered by their scope.

**Shortcuts**

- `<Control>+t` - Toggle Tagbar

####>>> Rainbow Parentheses / Auto Pairs <<<
Complex code may come with multiple level of parenthesis and quote (includes but not only (), [], ""), the first plugin **[rainbow_parentheses.vim](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim)** helps you to highlight the same level of parentheses, using the color according to based on their levels, and our default theme of Vim [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) adds extra support for it to make the highlighted colors fit together with the theme itself. The later one **[auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs)** similates the behaviors of most IDEs that close the parenthesis or quote for you artificially according to multiple scenarios. Check out their official sites for more informations.

####>>> accelerated-smooth-scroll <<<
The default behavior of scrolling inside Vim would jump for the whole page (`<Control>+f` or `<Control>+b`) or half page instantly, it somehow makes it hard to track the position of your cursor and the lines you're focusing on. The plugin **[accelerated-smooth-scroll](https://github.com/yonchu/accelerated-smooth-scroll)** enable the scrolling with a smooth animation. Moreover, the scrolling speed will be increased if you consecutively scroll.

####>>> NERDCommenter <<<
**[NERDCommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)** helps you to comment or umcomment multiples line conveniently according to the type of file you're editting.

**Notes** that not all the shortcuts listed in [official Github repo](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) are working for some reason, the ones listed below are what we're mostly use, if you have new requirement, please open issues.

**Shortcuts**

`<Leader>` means `,` in current setting, you can modify this by changing the 138 line of your `.vimrc` configuration file.

- `<Leader>+c+c` - Comment the line(s) you selected
- `<Leader>+c+u` - Un-comment the line(s) you selected
- `<Leader>+c+c` - Toggle the comment status of selected line(s)
- `<Leader>+c+y` - Same as <Leader>+c+c expect that the commented line(s) are yanked first
- `<Leader>+c+A` - Add comment delimiter to the end of current line and go into INSERT mode

####>>> neocomplete.vim <<<
I'm migrating to **[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)** from **[neocomplete.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)** as the auto completion plugin.

Notes that in order to support Java auto-completion, the installtion script will have Ecplise for Java installed by Homebrew-cask and [Eclim](http://eclim.org/) for accessing Eclipse code editing feature.

<To Be Edited>

## Why it is tube-vim
I started this project when I was working on a Yahoo! Japan's audience data pipeline, which is internally named **Tube**. Since I used most of the settings from within thie repo for that project, later I decided to rename it as **tube-vim** as a memorial.
